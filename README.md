## Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is my submission for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.
The project aims to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

## Dataset

In the next link you can find the data for the project:

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

## Files included in my repo:

        CodeBook.md:  
        Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.

        run_analysis.R:
        Performs the data collection followed by the next 5 steps (in that order).
        
        1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
        3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
        5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
        
        FinalData.txt:
        In this document is stored the tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
